# MÃ¡rcio Drumond
<sub>*Lead Data Scientist* at Center of Development of Nuclear Technology</sub>

As a Data Scientist and Radiological Protection Supervisor, I combine analytical skills, the ability to work in team environments, and attention to detail. Having spent the last years applying radioprotection principles to the Brazilian Nuclear Area problems, I developed critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

My credentials include a Master's in Radiation Science and Technology from the Center of Development of Nuclear Technology (CDTN), a CNEN (National Commission of Nuclear Energy) institution of higher education, and advanced research rated as one of the top and most prestigious nuclear research institutes in Brazil.

**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, Radioprotection and Mathematical Optimisation.
